## Libraries 

FamiStudio uses some external libraries for sound emulation, import and export to various formats. Many thanks to the developers working on these.

### Nes_Snd_Emu
Created by [Blargg](http://www.slack.net/~ant/). It also includes improvements they made later on in Game_Music_Emu. Was also modified by me to add a few more expansions.

### NotSoFatso
Created by [Disch](http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php/Not_So,_Fatso!). Was stripped down to only keep the audio emulation core and is used for the NSF import.

### emu2149 and emu2413
Created by by [Mitsutaka Okazaki](https://github.com/okaxaki). emu2149 is currently unused by the code.

### ShineMp3
Created by Gabriel Bouvigne, Pete Everett, Patrick Roberts and others. Used for the MP3 export.

### Vorbis 
Created by the [Xiph.Org Foundation](https://xiph.org/). Used for the OGG/Vorbis export.
